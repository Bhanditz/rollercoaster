[Svpply](http://www.supply.com/)'s tablet experience is simple and effective: what stands out immediately are the big, bright navigation tags on top. Once tapped, they expose deeper levels of more specific tags, updating the product selection at every step. As a navigation metaphor, they're super easy to find and understand, and entice the visitor to explore rather than search.

And, from a responsive design perspective, the tags are interesting too: because they incorporate a line wrap, they work fine at all screen widths.
