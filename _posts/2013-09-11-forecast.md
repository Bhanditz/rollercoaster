[Forecast](http://www.forecast.io/) is in many ways the poster child of what a modern tablet-optimized app should be like. You get an overview of the current and upcoming temperatures at a glance, fonts are easy to read, and interaction with the grey + icons results in instant unfolding of more detailed info.

A somewhat more hidden part of the site, but equally nifty is [Forecast Lines](http://www.forecast.io/lines) which shows the levels of expected temperature, precipipation, wind, etc. as resolution-independent SVG graphs. 

More of this, please!
