[Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com/) is a site that wants to help people find important, meaningful content online. 

Upworthy shines on tablets because of its simplicity: you get to see six stories on initial load, and every time you click the big, orange "Load More Stories", nine more are shown. Easy-to-read text, big buttons and straightfoward navigation do the rest.
