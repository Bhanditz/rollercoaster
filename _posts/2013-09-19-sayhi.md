[Hi](http://sayhi.co/) is all about "realtime storytelling and publishing" — you capture a moment with your phone's camera, for instance, and then share it with a snippet of text or a short story on Hi. Other visitors then can explore these stories per location, per author, etc. 

The whole site is nicely responsive, and uses a smooth mix of large serifs and sans-serifs that are easy on the eyes on tablets, and provide you with comfortable hit areas for further exploration.
