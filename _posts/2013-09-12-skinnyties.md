Every time I check out [Skinny Ties](http://skinnyties.com/), there's a smile on my face. Not only do the ties look amazing, but also the Skinny Ties website is fabulous and shines on tablets.

There's the horizontally scrolling "washing line" of suggested ties on the front page, easy-to-use top navigation options with touch-friendly drop-downs — check out the fingerprint-sized color selector, for instance —, and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-enzo-web">FF Enzo</a> at those comfortable sizes is a great font choice.
