We love [The Verge](http://theverge.com/)'s use of big, rectangular tiles as entry points to its top stories: they have nice large hit areas, and the background images with gradient overlays make for an interesting visual effect.

What we're not such big fans of:

* the not very fat-finger-friendly "Section" and "Trending" navigation strips on top
* the social icons to the left of the search box — they're just too tiny
