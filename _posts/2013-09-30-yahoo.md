The [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/) frontpage is a great example of a news site that's surprisingly ready for tablet browsing. 

The top bar with its collapsed navigation dropdown — good choice — and search box stays visible at all times, and makes navigation a breeze. And although we're no big fans of galleries, the one used here works surprisingly well: you can flick between stories using horizontal swipes or by tapping the film strip previews at the bottom. 

A special mention also for the interesting horizontal news category menu (in purple) in the middle of the page. Instead of showing all categories, only a few are displayed, and the rest can be reached with a horizontal swipe. Some kinetic scrolling would be nice, so that it's easier to reach the rightmost category, but it's an interesting concept nonetheless.

Other stuff: fonts are readable without zooming, content is dynamically loaded when reaching the bottom of the page, and there's a handy back-to-top button in the down right corner.
